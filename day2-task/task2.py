# Question 2: Solving Linear Equations with SciPy
#
# Given the system of equations:
# 2x + 3y = 8
# 3x + 4y = 11
#
# Represent the system of equations in matrix form AX = B.
# Use scipy.linalg.solve to find the values of x and y.

import  numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import solve

# Represent the system of equations in matrix form AX = B
A = np.array([[2, 3], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([8, 11])

# Use scipy.linalg.solve to find the values of x and y
solution = solve(A, B)
x, y = solution

print("Solution: x =", x, "y =", y)
